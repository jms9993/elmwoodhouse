   <h2>
      Cancellation Policy 
   </h2>
   Elmwood House is a small inn and cancellations impact us significantly. When we guarantee an accommodation, we make that particular unit unavailable to others for the duration of the booking. With only four units, a single cancellation can have a very big impact on our business. With that in mind, our policies are outlined below:
   </br>
     </br>
<em><strong>Cancellation Policy:  </strong></em> If a change to reservation or cancellation is made 15 or more days prior to reservation there will be a $25 processing fee and the balance of the deposit will be refunded.  Reservations cancelled less than 15 days but more than 2 days prior to arrival will forfeit their one night deposit.  If cancellation is received within 2 days of the reservation the full amount of the stay will be charged.
